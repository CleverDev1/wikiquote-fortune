NOTES
	If you use wikiquote-fortune to create a fortune cookie package
	please consider submitting it to wikiquote-fortune-collection at
	<https://github.com/maandree/wikiquote-fortune-collection>.
	Doing so means that I will (unless you perfer to it youself)
	maintain it for the Arch Linux User Repository and will do my
	best to make sure wikiquote-fortune will work with new versions
	of the Wikiquote page.

RATIONALE
	We have a myriad of people adding quotes to Wikiquote. Why not
	utilise this for fortune-mod?
