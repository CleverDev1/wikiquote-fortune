Script the generates fortune cookies for
fortune-mod from Wikiquote.


USAGE:  wikiquote-fortune SHOW_NAME

	Generates the file `quotes` with all
	quotes from the Wikiquote source, and
	the file `version` with the date and
	time the source was last edited in
	the format `yymmddHHMM`.

or	wikiquote-fortune SHOW_NAME date-only

	Generates only the `version` file.


If you use wikiquote-fortune to create a fortune cookie package
please consider submitting it to wikiquote-fortune-collection at
<https://github.com/maandree/wikiquote-fortune-collection>.
Doing so means that I will (unless you perfer to it youself)
maintain it for the Arch Linux User Repository and will do my
best to make sure wikiquote-fortune will work with new versions
of the Wikiquote page.
